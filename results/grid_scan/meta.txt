         Ψ-Continuum Grid Scan Summary
===============================================

Parameter grid:
  ε₀ range : [0.000, 0.300]  (31 steps)
  n   range : [-2.000, 2.000]  (81 steps)
  Minimization: H₀ optimized at each grid point

Best-fit ΨCDM parameters (H(z) only):
  ε₀*  = 0.3000
  n*   = 1.0500
  H₀*  = 72.0409  km/s/Mpc
  χ²*  = 60.391

ΛCDM baseline:
  H₀*  = 68.0348  km/s/Mpc
  χ²   = 21.636

Comparison:
  Δχ²(Ψ − Λ) = +38.755
  → ΛCDM provides a better fit to H(z).

Physical interpretation:
  • Best-fit n > 1 implies a rapidly increasing Ψ-density
    at higher redshift (non-standard behavior).

Notes:
  • Only H(z) dataset was used.
  • No SN or BAO constraints included in this grid.
  • This scan tests background expansion only.
  • Perturbations and structure formation are not included.
